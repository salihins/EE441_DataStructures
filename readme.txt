Project 1----

In this homework, you are asked to implement a user interface and the corresponding
database of students for ‘EE441’ course. The database entries will be instances of a custommade Student class. The database itself will be an instance of a Course class. Student and
Course classes and the user interface for the ‘EE441’ course will be designed and implemented
in this homework.

As a teaching assistant, your first task of the semester is to divide students into three
laboratory sections: Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday each of which has limited capacity.
Since students have different course schedules, assigning them randomly is not an option.
Therefore, you have asked them to submit their preferences based on which you can assign
them to the eligible sections. However, there are an exponential number of ways to assign
students and it is not easy to know which one is the best. To choose the best one, you have
decided to code some of them and make your computer do all the work to finish the task as
fast as possible. Now, you are going to implement your first grouping algorithm by using class,
stack, and queue data structures.

A single core CPU can typically run a single process at a time. However, computers are required to run several processes concurrently, e.g. a web browser, a word processor and a printer spooler. Due to the architecture of CPU, such processes have to run sequentially. Deciding which process runs at a certain time instant is one of the main tasks of operating systems, known as ‘process scheduling’.
The process scheduler keeps a data structure to hold the processes that will be executed, which is known as the ‘Ready Queue (RQ)’. When the user starts a new process, the process is inserted into the RQ according its priority. The RQ stores the processes in decreasing priority order such that the highest priority process is always at the front of the RQ. When CPU is ready, the process scheduler selects the next process to execute as the process at the front of the RQ. When the CPU finishes the execution, the process is deleted from RQ. Then, the scheduler selects the next process to be executed from the RQ.
In this homework, you are asked to implement a simple OS process scheduler.
